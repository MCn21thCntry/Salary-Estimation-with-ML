# Machine Learning with Salary Prediction

This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict the salaries of baseball players based on their performance statistics from the year 1986.

## Problem Statement

Develop a machine learning model that predicts baseball players' salaries using their 1986 career statistics and salary data.

## Dataset Story

The dataset was originally sourced from the StatLib library at Carnegie Mellon University. It was part of the data used in the 1988 ASA Graphics Section Poster Session. Salary data were initially sourced from Sports Illustrated's April 20, 1987, issue, while the 1986 and career statistics were sourced from the 1987 Baseball Encyclopedia Update published by Collier Books, Macmillan Publishing Company, New York.

## Data Fields

- **AtBat**: Number of times at bat during the 1986-1987 season.
- **Hits**: Number of hits during the 1986-1987 season.
- **HmRun**: Number of most valuable hits during the 1986-1987 season.
- **Runs**: Number of runs scored during the 1986-1987 season.
- **RBI**: Number of runs batted in by a player during the 1986-1987 season.
- **Walks**: Number of walks (mistakes by the pitcher) during the 1986-1987 season.
- **Years**: Number of years the player has been in the major leagues.
- **CAtBat**: Career total at-bats.
- **CHits**: Career total hits.
- **CHmRun**: Career total home runs.
- **CRuns**: Career total runs scored.
- **CRBI**: Career total runs batted in.
- **CWalks**: Career total walks.
- **League**: League the player belonged to at season's end ('A' or 'N').
- **Division**: Division the player was in at the end of 1986 ('E' or 'W').
- **PutOuts**, **Assists**, **Errors**: Fielding statistics.
- **Salary**: Salary of the player in thousands of dollars for the 1986-1987 season.
- **NewLeague**: League of the player at the beginning of 1987 ('A' or 'N').
